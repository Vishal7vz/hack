```javascript
// AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
const key = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, 100000, 32, 'sha512');
const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-gcm', key);
```

### 3. Web3 Identity Verification
```javascript
// Ethereum blockchain integration for identity verification
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY');
const identityHash = ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes(dataString));
```

### 4. Network Security Monitoring
```javascript
// Real-time network monitoring with Socket.io
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('subscribe-threats', () => {
    socket.join('threat-monitoring');
  });
});
